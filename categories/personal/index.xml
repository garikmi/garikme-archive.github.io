      <description>I have been a Christian Baptist since I was young. I wondered: if God’s existence is a fact, why many people do not believe in “his” existence? Do they want to burn in hell for eternity? In this search for, so called, truth, I eventually became an atheist for some time. As I grew more mature, I realized that “that” approach was also faulty when I asked myself this question: can I be 100% sure there is no God?</description>
